carlton,,Interview with Beverly Carlton,,Lexi Robinson,AppState Student Interview Collection,11/9/2024,,"Beverly Forney Carlton grew up in Morganton under Jim Crow with no unsupervised trips outside of her neighborhood. After Mountain View Elementary opened in 1958, Carlton walked 41 minutes or two miles to school across town. She states that walking through town required hyperviligance that ""you don't step on land bombs."" After her parents and other families appeared before the school board to ask for transportation, they reassigned the complainants to white schools closer to their homes. Carlton felt unprepared for the pain and hostility she experienced when she was reassigned to Central School downtown for 1963 and 1964 school years.

class-photo,,"Mountain View Elementary School, Third Grade Class Photo",,,Dixon Byrd; History Museum of Burke County,1965,,"Photograph of Ms. Woody's third grade class at Mountain View Elementary School during the first year of desegregation in Burke County. Faced with many years of activism by Black families, especially the West Concord Mothers, local churches, and NAACP, as well as the threat of losing federal funding with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Burke County's schools consolidated and desegregated in 1965. The three previously separate school systems (Morganton City, Glen Alpine, and Burke County) merged into one, and all students were assigned to the school closest to their home. From its opening in 1958 to 1965, Mountain View Elementary was an all-Black school serving grades one through eight. As a result of desegregation in 1965, only 12 of the 26 Black teachers in the school system were rehired. Later that year, nine Black teachers who were not rehired sued the Morganton City School Board. In the case of Arthur Baglis Buford, et al v. The Morganton City Board of Education, Judge Braxton Craven ultimately rejected the teachers' argument of discrimination and sided with the School Board.
