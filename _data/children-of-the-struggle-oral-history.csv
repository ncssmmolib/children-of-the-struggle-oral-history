As a result of desegregation in 1965, only 12 of the 26 Black teachers in the school system were rehired. Later that year, nine Black teachers who were not rehired sued the Morganton City School Board. In the case of Arthur Baglis Buford, et al v. The Morganton City Board of Education, Judge Braxton Craven ultimately rejected the teachers' argument of discrimination and sided with the School Board. Desegregation resulted in many Black teachers leaving Burke County due to this loss of employment.",desegregation; Mountain View Elementary; photograph; primary source,"Morganton, North Carolina",35.7368,-81.6918,Dixon Byrd; History Museum of Burke County,class-photo,image;stillimage,image/jpg,eng,"In Copyright - Educational Use Permitted.

johnson,,"Interview with Richard Johnson, Christobel Johnson, and Andrea Chambers Lytle",,Leslie D. McKesson; Jeronimo Martin,Leslie D. McKesson Collection,2022-05-03,,"""Among the first students to desegregate Morganton public schools in 1963, Richard Johnson, Christobel Johnson, and Andrea Chambers Lytle share their stories of racial violence and discrimination. 

Richard and Christoble Johnson are the children of Lucille Johnson Rutherford, one of the Seven Mothers. In 1963, Christoble was among the “first wave” of Black students to attend formerly white schools as a result of the Seven Mothers’ activism. She transferred from Mountain View Elementary School to Morganton Junior High for seventh grade, which resulted in being isolated from her siblings and peers as administrators assigned Black students one to a class.

Richard Johnson was among the “first wave” of students to desegregate Morganton High School. His mother sent him to school for a quality education but no one accounted for the hostility and threats he would receive. Richard, Christoble, and Andrea recall the loneliness and rejection of sitting at a cafeteria table only for other students to move away, being served cold food at the end of lunch periods, having to dance alone or play basketball alone. As Christoble states, “We got abused for quality.”""",Richard Johnson; Christoble Johnson; Andrea Chambers Lytle; desegregation; Mountain View Elementary; Morganton Junior High; discrimination; Central School; Forest Hill Elementary; Morganton High School; harrassment; fights; nonviolence; teachers; racial epithets; verbal abuse; W.F.
