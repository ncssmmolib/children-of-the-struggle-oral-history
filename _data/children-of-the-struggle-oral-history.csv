Faced with many years of activism by Black families, especially the West Concord Mothers, local churches, and NAACP, as well as the threat of losing federal funding with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Burke County's schools consolidated and desegregated in 1965. The three previously separate school systems (Morganton City, Glen Alpine, and Burke County) merged into one, and all students were assigned to the school closest to their home. From its opening in 1958 to 1965, Mountain View Elementary was an all-Black school serving grades one through eight. As a result of desegregation in 1965, only 12 of the 26 Black teachers in the school system were rehired. Later that year, nine Black teachers who were not rehired sued the Morganton City School Board. In the case of Arthur Baglis Buford, et al v. The Morganton City Board of Education, Judge Braxton Craven ultimately rejected the teachers' argument of discrimination and sided with the School Board.
