carlton,,Interview with Beverly Carlton,,Lexi Robinson,AppState Student Interview Collection,11/9/2024,,"Beverly Forney Carlton grew up in Morganton under Jim Crow with no unsupervised trips outside of her neighborhood. After Mountain View Elementary opened in 1958, Carlton walked 41 minutes or two miles to school across town. She states that walking through town required hyperviligance that â€œyou donâ€™t step on land bombs.â€ After her parents and other families appeared before the school board to ask for transportation, they reassigned the complainants to white schools closer to their homes. Carlton felt unprepared for the pain and hostility she experienced when she was reassigned to Central School downtown for 1963 and 1964 school years.
