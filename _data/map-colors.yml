# Map Marker Color Configuration
#
# This file controls the colors of location markers on the map.
# Each category can have a custom color and border color.
#
# HOW TO USE:
# 1. Add a "map_category" column to your CSV file
# 2. In that column, enter one of the category names below (e.g., "school", "church", "home")
# 3. To add a new color category, just add it to the list below following the same format
# 4. To change colors, modify the color and border values (use hex codes like #3388ff)
#
# FINDING COLOR CODES:
# - Use a color picker tool like https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/
# - Or use common color names and convert them to hex codes
#
