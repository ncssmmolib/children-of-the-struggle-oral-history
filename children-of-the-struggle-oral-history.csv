harbison,,Interview with Gary Harbison,Gary Harbison,Alex Bouk; Ethan Scheurich,,2024-11-09,,"Gary Harbison attended Mountain View Elementary, a segregated elementary school. At age 14, he desegregated Morganton Junior High School. He fondly remembers growing up in his community and Mountain View Recreation Center being an important gathering place to play sports, hold dances, swim, meet people from other cities like Gastonia. Harbison speaks about the difficulties and pain of desegregation and details the 1968 student walkout. Harbison was part of efforts to honor the West Concord Mothers who organized for transportation and achieved the pilot desegregation program for their children. He facilitated a Black History Month event at New Day Christian and asked the surviving Mothers and their children to speak. He also worked with Dr. Leslie McKesson to install a historical marker at Slades Chapel AME Church downtown to honor the Mothers.",Gary Harbison; oral history; primary source,"Morganton, NC",35.73679724,-81.69177026,"AppState Student Interviews, Dr. Leslie D.
