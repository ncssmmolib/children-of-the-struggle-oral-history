## The Children of the Struggle 

Children of the Struggle is a digital collaboration building upon decades of community work to document and preserve the stories of Black residents who experienced desegregation and fought for civil rights in Burke County, North Carolina.

This project honors the lives and work of the West Concord Mothers and their descendants, who are also referred to as the "Seven Mothers" or the "Big Seven." From 1958 to 1963 (and beyond), Annie J. Hicks, Ruth Forney, Willette Chambers, Laura Thomas, Lucille Rutherford, Mildred Largent, and Rose Johnson petitioned Morganton City School Board and the Morganton City Council for their children to attend the schools closest to their homes, which were the segregated white schools. If the City did not meet their request, the Seven Mothers were prepared to escort their children to the all-white Forest Hill Elementary School, the school closest to their homes. In response to the Mothers' organizing along with pressure from the local branch of the NAACP, Slades Chapel AME Church, Gaston Chapel AME Church, and New Bethel Baptist Church, the Morganton School Board launched a pilot desegregation in 1963. Thirty Black students from West Concord Street were reassigned to the formerly all-white schools closer to their homes for the 1963-1964 school year. These students are sometimes referred to as being part of "the first wave" of desegregation in Burke County schools.

## About the Project 

The digital side of the Children of the Struggle combines several new and existing collections: 

- Interviews from the History Museum of Burke County. In 2015, the [History Museum of Burke County](https://www.thehistorymuseumofburke.org/) began conducting interviews about public school desegregation and developed an exhibit by the name "Children of the Struggle." The exhibit launched in 2017 and is still running as of 2025. It is located in the basement of the History Museum at 201 W Meeting St in Morganton, NC and admission to the Museum is free. *insert photo?*

- Interviews, primary sources, and secondary sources from the historical marker committee. In 2022, Dr. Leslie D. McKesson formed a historical marker committee of a group of local activists, archivists, and community members in order to research and install a [historical marker at Slades Chapel AME Church](https://aahc.nc.gov/programs/nc-civil-rights-trail/nc-civil-rights-virtual-trail/slades-chapel-1961). With the support of the [North Carolina Room at the Burke County Public Library](https://bcpls.org/index.php/ncroom/), this committee conducted additional interviews of Black residents who were students during desegregation, specifically the children and friends of the West Concord Mothers. The committee compiled and submitted a packet of primary and secondary sources to make the case for a historical marker installation honoring the West Concord Mothers. Their proposal was successful and the marker was installed on ****, 2023. For more on the historical marker, see here. *insert marker photo*

- Interviews from Dr. Leslie D. McKesson's students at Appalachian State University. In Fall 2024, Dr. Leslie D. McKesson taught a public history course to undergraduate students at Appalachian State University. The course focused on desegregation of public schools in North Carolina and, specifically, Burke County. As part of the course, her students conducted fourteen interviews on November 9, 2024 at New Day Christian Church in Morganton. *insert interview day photo*
